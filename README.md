# Terminal Canvas (cterm)
Created because I don't like the alternatives :D

## To Do:
- Draw Example:
    - re-enable move cursor
    - loop and print a box around the current terminal 
- Get immediate key input example (without raw mode. unless we need to) (4-input)
- Change colorsColors
- Color Example (3-colors)
